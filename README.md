Instructions:

1. All members will contribute to solutions to the below programming problems using the steps in ‘Introduction to Github’ Github Lab course.
  Programming problems source: Chapter 1, Fundamentals of Python: Data Structures , 2nd Edition ( See METIS books, PreLab section)

    ·  Programming Problem 1:
      Statisticians would like to have a set of functions to compute the median and mode of a list of numbers. The median is the number that
      would appear at the midpoint of a list if it were sorted. The mode is the number that appears most
      frequently in the list. Define these functions in a module named stats.py. Also include a function named mean,
      which computes the average of a set of numbers. Each function expects a list of numbers as an argument and returns a single
      number.

    · Programming Problem 2:
      Write a program that allows the user to navigate through the lines of text in a file. The program prompts the
      user for a filename and inputs the lines of text into a list. The program then enters a loop in which it prints
      the number of   lines in the file and prompts the user for a line number. Actual line
      numbers range from 1 to the number of lines in the file. If the input is 0, the program quits. Otherwise,
      the program prints the line associated with that number.9

3. Follow the Lab Report Template PostLab Guide on what to include (i.e. Discussion, Screenshots, etc.)

IMPORTANT: Members should create their own branch and commit the files/source codes of the programming problem assigned task(s).
          The leader of the group will merge all commits in the member’s own branch to the group’s common Github repo.
